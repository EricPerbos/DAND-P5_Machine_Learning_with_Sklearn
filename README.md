### Goal and Background

The goal of this machine learning project is to build a classifier to identify "Persons of Interest" (POI) in the Enron scandal.  

The Enron scandal was the largest case of corporate fraud in the history of the United States and several persons were indicted or found guilty of misappropriation of large sums of money.

We have two types of features available in the dataset: financial and email-related.
The financial ones include salary, bonus, expenses, stock options and other forms of financial compensations.
The email-related ones indicate the volume of emails sent and received by each person, and also in relation with the identified POI's.
